# fcc-back-end-development-and-apis
## Context
My 5 Node.js and Express.js projects that I've built as part of my freeCodeCamp assignment.



## Overview
Building these projects allowed me to obtain new skills and familiarize myself more with the Server side (Backend) programming.
I learned how to write back end apps with Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager). I also learned how to build and built web applications with the Express framework, along a microservice with MongoDB and the Mongoose library.
## Certification
These projects also allowed me to obtain my <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/ilyas-moutawwakil/back-end-development-and-apis">Back End Development and APIs</a> which is a Developer Certification, representing approximately 300 hours of coursework.
